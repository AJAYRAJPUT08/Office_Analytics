"""
Attendance Engine
-----------------
This is the core business logic of the AI Employee Time Tracking +
Payment System. It owns:

  - Debounced entry/exit detection from raw per-frame face recognitions
  - Open attendance sessions (employee currently inside, with entry time)
  - Closed attendance records (entry, exit, duration, payment) persisted
    to disk so Reports / Payment Logs survive a restart
  - The "currently identified employee" live panel shown on Overview
  - The real-time activity log feed

Architecturally this replaces the old project's state.py, but reuses
its thread-safe singleton + debounce pattern.
